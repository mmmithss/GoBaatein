# Go Baatein üåê

## Project Overview

**Go Baatein** is a social platform designed to bridge the linguistic diversity of India by enabling people from different dialects and language backgrounds to interact using **English as a common language**. Unlike traditional language learning apps that are often text-heavy or focused on foreign languages, Go Baatein provides a **real-time, peer-to-peer communication platform** to help Indians connect, interact, and naturally learn new regional languages while making friends.



## Problem Statement

In a linguistically diverse country like India, there is a **lack of dedicated social platforms that facilitate language learning and cultural exchange through real-time interaction**. Most existing apps focus on foreign languages or offer isolated learning experiences that don't encourage conversational practice.

**Go Baatein addresses this gap** by providing:

* A **common platform for users to communicate across dialects using English.**
* Opportunities for users to **practice and learn Indian languages naturally** through chats, video calls, and friendships.

* **Authentication:** JWT + Cookies

#### Key Components:

* User Service: Authentication, Profile Management
* Friendship Service: Friend Requests, Friends List
* Messaging Service: Stream Chat Integration
* Video Call Service: Stream Video API Integration
* (Future) Language Matching and Recommendations


### 3. Technology Stack
